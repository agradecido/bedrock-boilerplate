# Bedrock WordPress Boilerplate with Docker

This repository contains a Bedrock WordPress Boilerplate setup with Docker, providing an easy and modern and flexible environment for WordPress development.

## Quick Start

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository onto your machine:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/agradecido/bedrock-boilerplate.git
```
### Bedrock Boilerplate

After cloning the repository, if you prefer a fresh Bedrock installation instead of using the existing one in the repo, you can delete the 'bedrock' directory and run the following command at the root directory of your repository:

```bash
$ composer create-project roots/bedrock
```

This will create 'bedrock' directory and install a new Bedrock project in.

Or you can update the provided:

```bash
$ cd bedrock
$ composer update
```

- Create a `.env` file for Bedrock. You can use the `.env.example` provided in the Bedrock directory as a template. This file should include:
  - Database credentials (`DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`)
  - WordPress environment settings (`WP_ENV`, `WP_HOME`, `WP_SITEURL`)
  - Authentication unique keys and salts (can be generated using a WordPress salt generator)
  - The database host (and the other database re√±ated information) in the Bedrock .env file should be set to the name of the SQL container, which will be created by Docker in the subsequent steps.

### Docker Environment

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. If you don't have Docker installed, follow [the official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
2. Create a `.env` file in 'docker' directory based on the `.env.example` file provided in the repo. This file allows you to configure several aspects of your Docker environment, including:
  - PHP version (e.g., `PHPVERSION=php81`)
  - SQL server version (e.g., `DATABASE=mariadb104`)
  - Credentials for the database (e.g., `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`)
  - Ports for various services
  - Other environment-specific configurations
